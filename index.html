    <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
  

I’m Jananidurgha M , an enthusiastic and motivated learner from the<bold> Electronics and Communication Engineering</bold> (ECE) department at <bold>PSNA College of Engineering and Technology</bold>. While my core studies focus on electronics and communication systems, I have developed a strong interest in web development and programming, which allows me to creatively blend logic, design, and technology.

I enjoy working with languages like HTML, Python, C, and C++, and love building interactive, user-friendly applications. From responsive web pages to logical games and tools, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code.

As an <bold>intern at Prodigy Infotech</bold>, I had the opportunity to apply my skills to real-world projects, which helped enhance my technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities. I’m passionate about continuous learning and excited to grow both as an engineer and a developer.
